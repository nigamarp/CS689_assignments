Answer for Q3 is already submitted on the given website

Constraints:
IndicBERT model is not given the whole corpus as it took too long to tokenize.
I have also not run bpe2k on the whole corpus as it took too much time for each function to give the output.

Note - 
1.The Characters ,Syllables and Tokens which are printed for Q1 are the desired unigrams for Q2.
2.I have conidered unicode correction for words like "चाँद" as " च + आ + अं + द + अ".
